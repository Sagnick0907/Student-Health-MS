1. I made Enrollment_no in s_health table foreign key taking ref. from Enrollment_no in students table.
   Though not added any constraint on delete or update but written the code for it in delete_student.php
    query---->  ALTER TABLE `s_health` ADD CONSTRAINT `Foreign key` FOREIGN KEY (`Enrollment_no`) REFERENCES `students`(`Enrollment_no`) ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION;

//problems
1. Pass_hash not working for student sign up and login
2.<form action="/shms/admin_dashboard.php?enroll_no=<?php echo $Enroll_no; ?>" method="post">
                    <input type="submit" name="back" value="back">
                    
     </form>
